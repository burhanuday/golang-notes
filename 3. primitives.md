# Primitives

## boolean

```go
var n bool = false

m := 1 == 1

var x bool //=> initialised as false
```

## numeric types

### int

- int8
- int16
- int32
- int64
- uint // unsigned int has equivalent for every size from 16 to 64

by default int has platform specific size

arithmetic with two diff integer types is not allowed. type conversion is required

### float

- float32
- float64 // default

### complex

complex numbers

- complex128
- complex64
- complex32

```go
var n complex = 1 + 2i
real(n) //=> 1
imag(n) //=> 2

complex(5, 12)
```

## text types

### string

strings can be treated as an array of ascii byte codes

strings are immutable

### rune

same as char
alias for int32
