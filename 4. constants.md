# Constants

- all constants are preceeded with `const` keyword
- name constants the same way you name other variables - camelcase
- if the first letter is uppercase, it will be exported
- constants cannot be something that is calculated on runtime
- constants can be shadowed

## Typed constants

```go
const myConst int = 42
```

## Enumerated constants

```go
const (
    a = iota
    b = iota
    c = iota
)

// a=> 0
// b=> 1
// c=> 2
```
